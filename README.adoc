= Bridge: Nginx-Zig
:bridge_tech: Zig 0.11+
:target: Nginx C-Binary

== Purpose
This bridge uses **Zig** to create a high-integrity interface between Ephapax linear tokens and Nginx C-buffers. It eliminates "Configuration Drift" by treating Nginx configs as linear matter.

== Secure Handover
The Zig layer validates the configuration buffer provided by the Ephapax supervisor before passing the pointer to the Nginx internal cycle.

== Install
[source,bash]
